INGREDIENTS

30 g Cheddar cheese
extra virgin olive oil

METHOD
	
Cut the fish into 10 x 120g portions. I tend to cut the side lengthways about 3cm thick, then into chunks from that.
In a shallow bowl:
whisk the eggs with the paprika and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. 
Tear the bread into a food processor, grate in the cheese, add 2 tbsp of oil and whiz until you have breadcrumbs, then tip into a tray.
Coat each fish portion in the egg mixture, let any excess drip off, then turn in the breadcrumbs until well coated all over.
Transfer to a tray lined with greaseproof paper, layering them up between sheets of paper until they’re all coated.  
Cook right away or freeze in the tray – once frozen, you can pop them into a tub or sandwich bags for easier storage.
